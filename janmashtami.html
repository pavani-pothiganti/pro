    <h1>Janmashtami - The Story of Birth of Lord Krishna</h1>
    <h2>Krishna Janmashtami is one of the most popular festivals, which is celebrated with zeal and fervor all over the country. It is also known as Janmashtami, Ashtami Rohini, Shree Jayanti, Gokulashtami, Krishnashtami, Dahi Handi and Saatam Aatham.
        Krishna is one of the most adored and worshipped God in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth manifestation of Bhagwan Vishnu. He is the God of protection, sympathy, tenderness, joy and love.
        According to the Lunisolar Hindu calendar, Hindus celebrate Krishna’s birthday every year on Krishna Janmashtami, which is at the end of August or the beginning of September as per the Gregorian calendar.
        He is a central figure in the Mahabharata, Bhagavata Purana, Garuda Purana, Padma Purana and Bhagavad Gita.
        In the Padma Purana (Uttara-khanda 193.3)
        
        Puranesu tu sarvesu srimad bhagavatam param|
        yatra prati-padam krsno giyate bahudharsibhih||
        'Of all the puranas, the Bhagavata is the greatest. In every line the sages glorify Sri Krishna in various ways.'
        The name Krishna has several meanings like dark colored/skinned one. Sri Krishna, Draupadi and Vyasa are known as “Krishna”, because they were dark complexioned. Krishna also means one who attracts.
        
        Krishna also means one who harvests - He is thus the Kshetrajna, the farmer, horticulturist, gardener who knows when a particular crop or plant is ripe. Metaphorically he is the one who nurtures our consciousness and when it is ripe blesses with Moksha
        Why is Krishna Janma (Birth of Krishna) known as Janmashtami?
        The word ‘Janma’ means birth, and ‘Ashta’ in Sanskrit means eight. The number 8 has much significance, as Shri Krishna was the 8th avatar (incarnation) of Bhagwan Vishnu, He was the 8th child born to Devaki Mata, and he was born on the 8th day of the Krishna Paksha in the Holy month of Shravan .
        When Is Krishna Janmashtami in 2024 (Tithi & Muhurat)?
        This year the Krishna Janmashtami falls on Monday, August 26, 2024.
